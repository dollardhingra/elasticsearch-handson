# We now have about 20k products in the index!
# Let's search for them.
# Find *all* documents

GET /products_index/product/_search

# This is the same query.
GET /products_index/product/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match_all": {}
  }
}

# Let's find all necklaces!
GET /products_index/product/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "name": "necklace"
    }
  }
